OGGQUIZ(6)                   FreeBSD Games Manual                   OGGQUIZ(6)

NAME
     oggquiz -- a simple quiz on songs from your ogg/vorbis collection

SYNOPSIS
     oggquiz [-t | --time seconds] [-c | --choices choices]
             [-p | --players players] [-o | --ogg123-options options]
             [-O | --ogg123 command]

     oggquiz {-h | --help}

DESCRIPTION
     oggquiz is played in turns. Each turn one song is played and the current
     player is asked which song he is listening to. This is done in a multiple
     choice manner.

     The faster the player answers the less points he gets added to his cur-
     rent score. If the player gives the wrong answer or waits too long he
     gets the maximum amount of possible points added to his score.

     The player with the least points wins.

OPTIONS
     -t | --time seconds
                 Sets the time each player has to make his guess. Also deter-
                 mines the maximum score which equals seconds.  The default is
                 60.

     -c | -choices choices
                 Determines how many possible answers are presented to the
                 player. The default is 4.  choices must not exceed 4 and must
                 not be less than 1. The default is 4.

     -p | --players players
                 Determines how many players are playing the game.  players
                 must not exceed 4 and must not be less than 1. The default is
                 4.

     -o | --ogg123-options options
                 The given options are passed on to ogg123. This option should
                 be used with care as no sanity checking is performed.

     -O | --ogg123 command
                 The explicit command used to invoke ogg123. Might be another
                 player as as it supports ogg/vorbis and provides a -q flag
                 with the same semantics as ogg123's flag . The default is
                 ``/usr/local/bin/ogg123''.

     -h | --help
                 Print the synopsis of oggquiz and exit. This overrides any
                 other options.

HOW IT WORKS
     oggquiz reads a randomized list of ogg/vorbis files from stdin. Having
     read choices (see OPTIONS) files it stops and picks one of the just read
     songs and plays it via ogg123. It then presents the current player with a
     list of the read songs and asks which one is playing.

     If the player gives the wrong answer he gets the full seconds (see
     OPTIONS) added to his score.

     If the player gives the correct answer and he used less then seconds (see
     OPTIONS) seconds to give the answer he gets the amount of seconds he used
     added to his score. If the player uses more than seconds (see OPTIONS)
     seconds to give the answer he gets the same points as if he had given the
     wrong answer.

     After each turn a scoreboard is displayed. Always remember that the
     player with the lowest score wins.

     oggquiz has no real end. It ends if no more songs can be read from stdin
     or if one of the players decides to press the 'q' button and quit the
     game.

ENVIRONMENT
     oggquiz peruses the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables to determine
     the systems locale.

EXAMPLES
     I start my games like this:

           find /my/music -type f -name '*.ogg' | random -l -f - | oggquiz

PORTABILITY
     oggquiz was written in ANSI/C so it should compile on every unix-like
     platform supporting an ANSI/C compiler and libvorbis. But this was writ-
     ten on a FreeBSD system and has not been tested on other platforms.

     The supplied Makefile is a BSD-style Makefile and uses the FreeBSD infra-
     structure. This is not portable, but as oggquiz is pretty simple there
     should be no problem to write a simple Makefile for other platforms.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages should be self-explanatory.

     The oggquiz utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
