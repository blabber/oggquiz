oggquiz is played in turns. Each turn one song is played and the current player
is asked which song he is listening to. This is done in a multiple choice
manner.

The faster the player answers the less points he gets added to his current
score. If the player gives the wrong answer or waits too long he gets the
maximum amount of possible points added to his score.

The player with the least points wins.
